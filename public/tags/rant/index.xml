      <description>The reason no good deed goes unpunished is simple. God is evil. The reason for this is there is no god, there is only evil demons who have tricked the masses into thinking there is one, however I digress. I will explain to you the technical reasoning behind why this phenomon occurs.
As long as people pray they generally have happy lives and bad things never happen to them. However when they sin, the evil jehovah who is really satan, punishes you.</description>
