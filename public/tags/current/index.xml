      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;freedom-isn-t-free&#34;&gt;Freedom Isn&amp;rsquo;t Free&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than any time in history terrorists have been working to take away our freedoms. Every day our rights are being encroached upon by those who would hurt their fellow man. We should be concerned with making sure we do our duty as it directly affects our honor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;without-honor-there-is-nothing&#34;&gt;Without honor there is nothing.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a few meaningful quotes to inspire you to honor your duty and secure yourself as a dutiful person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus said to them, &amp;ldquo;A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home.&amp;rdquo; ~ &lt;a href=&#34;http://biblehub.com/mark/6-4.htm&#34;&gt;Mark 6:4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king. ~ &lt;a href=&#34;http://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-17.htm&#34;&gt;1 Peter 2:17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for some non biblical quotes&amp;hellip; Remember there is little we retain when we die besides our honor. Allah will judge us based on the honorable actions we performed while in this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who sows virtue reaps honor&amp;rdquo; ~ &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/l/leonardoda124544.html&#34;&gt;Leonardo da Vinci&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Long Hair on Men is an Abomination!</title>
      <link>https://fearness.org/articles/long-hair-abomination/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is common these days that portrayals the portrayals of Jesus show him to have long hair. It is common practice in modern art to depict Jesus as having long hair. Jesus was also black, but that isn&amp;rsquo;t the point of this article. The bible doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much to say about this topic but luckily what it does have to say is very definitive. There is one place in the bible where Paul tells us that long hair on men is bad. King James Version this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11%3A14&amp;amp;version=KJV&#34;&gt;1 Corinthians 11:14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that makes it very clear. It is a shame for men to have long hair. If you know of more bible testimony about this topic then feel free to email me.&lt;/p&gt;
