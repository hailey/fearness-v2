      <description>&lt;p&gt;Faith has guided me to make some cosmetic changes to the website. It is
inspired by Allah himself. In the name of God, the Most Gracious,
the most Merciful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my daily prayer the Lord spoke to me and told me that he has
great plans in store for me and those around me. It is now my quest to
deliver to you, an updated perspective on the things you should think,
feel and believe. It is not always easy to know where you stand but
I will make it my constant effort to let you know where God stands on
the subject. If you have any questions email me at this anti spam link
 &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:questions@fearness.org&#34;&gt;questions@fearness.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
