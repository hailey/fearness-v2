      <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems my predictions on Allahs arrival have been twarted by evil. I&amp;rsquo;m
 not sure why it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen but I assume there is some holy reason
 that is beyond me. In the meantime I will bring you meaningful quotes
 from the great Holy Quran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who
    are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame, etc.), and those who
    strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their
    lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight
    with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto
    each, Allah has promised good (Paradise), but Allah has preferred
    those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a
    huge reward - &lt;a href=&#34;http://quran.com/4/95-96&#34;&gt;Quran 4:95&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible
    that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing
    which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not. -
    &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.216&#34;&gt;Quran 2:216&lt;/a&gt;
