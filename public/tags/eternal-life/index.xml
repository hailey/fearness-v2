      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let us take a look at the chapter of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5&amp;amp;version=NIV&#34;&gt;2 Corinthians 5&lt;/a&gt;. We will be using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-International-Version-NIV-Bible/&#34;&gt;New International Version&lt;/a&gt; for this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord has for us inscribed on stone our perfect genetic structure, untouched by sin and virus. We are forever flawed by those of us who have committed sin. Sin creates all the hate, pain and suffering in the world and is responsible for the defects in our DNA that cause cancer and many types of sickness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let me take a moment to say that I hate it when people pick and choose verses without reading them in context. So we will read the whole chapter in tonight&amp;rsquo;s publication.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Meanwhile we groan, longing to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling, &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked. &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Now the one who has fashioned us for this very purpose is God, who has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come. - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5%3A1-5&amp;amp;version=NIV&#34;&gt;2 Corinthians 5:1-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly in this scripture the phrase &lt;em&gt;earthly tent&lt;/em&gt; refers to our initial existence on earth in our mortal body that has been corrupted by sin. It is also very important to note that the Lord will cloth you because nakedness is a sin. It is especially wrong to be naked inside your own house, especially a house that God built. Verse 5 tells us that God fashions us with whatever hardships and gains that we deserve to create the person that we are today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5%3A6&amp;amp;version=NIV&#34;&gt;2 Corinthians 5:6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as we remain in our mortal bodies on Earth we are separated from the Lord. We must remember that faith will guide our transition to our immortal bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;For we live by faith, not by sight. - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5%3A7&amp;amp;version=NIV&#34;&gt;2 Corinthians 5:7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faith is more important than what your mortal eyes can see and your mortal senses can sense. You must remember that beyond all of our mortal senses lives our perfect spirit which is tainted by the sin of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord. &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad. - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5%3A8-10&amp;amp;version=NIV&#34;&gt;2 Corinthians 5:8-10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scripture tells us that being with the Lord is preferable to life here on earth in our imperfect bodies. But rest assured that if you live a good life and repent and get baptized you might make it to be beside the hand of our Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
