      <description>My Credentials My credentials are simple. I have been an ordained minister since September of 2011. I have studied the ways of our lord since I was 7 years old. My mission is to spread the word to everyone that the lord calls upon. In 2011 it was my mission to work on spreading the good word to those around me to better the lives of everyone.
None of this happens by chance, but is pre destined by our lord Jesus Christ.</description>
