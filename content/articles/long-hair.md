It is common these days that portrayals the portrayals of Jesus show him to have long hair. It is common practice in modern art to depict Jesus as having long hair. Jesus was also black, but that isn't the point of this article. The bible doesn't have much to say about this topic but luckily what it does have to say is very definitive. There is one place in the bible where Paul tells us that long hair on men is bad. King James Version this time.

> <sup>14</sup>Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? [1 Corinthians 11:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11%3A14&version=KJV)

I think that makes it very clear. It is a shame for men to have long hair. If you know of more bible testimony about this topic then feel free to email me.
