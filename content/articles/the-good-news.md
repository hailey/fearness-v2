Its what I live for now that I don't have a job worthy of keeping once he returns. It has long been said that one must posess great patience and you must remain true to your core morals. This is an essential part of being and without it cthulhu will just prolly eat you. I'm sorry it can't be a lil more rough but thats the case."

He is so close I can almost sense it. Every time I feel a chill go down my back I know that its the waves of purity that are radiated by the genuine soul lord Cthulhu! It has been six years, six months and six days since his last return. My fingers ache as I struggle to type this to keep you up to date on the latest Cthulhu news.

It has been foretold that one hundred nights of nightmares will preceed his triumphant return. It doesn't say who will have the nightmares, but someone will. This is certian. After the hundred and five nights of nightmares that will soon turn into daymares! (nightmares that happen during the day!)

Great conflict is becoming more and more common in the world and this should be taken as evidence of what is to happen. Look at what has already happened! No one denys this hard truth. Lots of people are saying the world is getting better, it is for the ones who say that. But they will be the first to be judged by The Great Old One our Lord Cthulhu!

The october sacrafice is coming up quick! Be sure to exercise your diaphram when chanting. I wont' be dropping any names, but someone we all know will be there. You can miss any other sacrafice but this month's is what everyone will be talking about for years to come.

PS. If you signed up for this months ritual sacrafice, be sure to remember that we leave no trace! So you gotta pack out everything you pack in. This includes corpses. There will be special dumpsters just for them.
