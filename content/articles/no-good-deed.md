The reason no good deed goes unpunished is simple. God is evil. The reason for this is there is no god, there is only evil demons who have tricked the masses into thinking there is one, however I digress. I will explain to you the technical reasoning behind why this phenomon occurs.

As long as people pray they generally have happy lives and bad things never happen to them. However when they sin, the evil jehovah who is really satan, punishes you. Now it not be apparent at first but if you stop and help someone who is having a bad time, lets say change a flat tire. You effectively steal the lesson that satan was trying to teach that person.

What this means is that the person will not learn the lesson they should have learned about knowing how to change a tire. Changing a tire is basic car shit, seriously. So so, the interviening party, step in help out fix things and everything is happy right? Wrong! Evil Jehovah will punish you!

Don't help out. If you're driving on the road and you see people on the side of the road in an accident, in obviously critical medical condition and no one else is around, don't help out.

You may ask, "How do I prevent this from happening to me? I cant be mean to everyone!" Well, actually you can but that is not the point. These reactions are not always instentanious and you have time to counteract the good.

Lets say you indeed did stop to help out fix a tire, you will have to counter it with being mean or evil or a dick, generally finding a person who needs to have a lesson taught and teaching it. Fists and or arson are a good way to accomplish this.

You're at the gas station and a bum asks you for some change so you give him five dollars, a generous gift indeed. You dont worry about it because you know that you can take more from your mothers purse. Just be sure to remember the pin on her credit cards too. Shoes!

Just remember, think about yourself. You are the most important person. I know I am. So should you.
