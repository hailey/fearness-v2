It seems my predictions on Allahs arrival have been twarted by evil. 
I'm not sure why it didn't happen but I assume there is some holy reason
that is beyond me. In the meantime I will bring you meaningful quotes
from the great Holy Quran.
 

>	Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those
	who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame, etc.), and those who 
	strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their
	lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight 
	with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto
	each, Allah has promised good (Paradise), but Allah has preferred 
	those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a 
	huge reward - [Quran 4:95](http://quran.com/4/95-96)

>	Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is
	possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye 
	love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know 
	not. - 
	[Quran - 2:216](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.216)
