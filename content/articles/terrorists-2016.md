# Freedom Isn't Free

More than any time in history terrorists have been working to take away our freedoms. Every day our rights are being encroached upon by those who would hurt their fellow man. We should be concerned with making sure we do our duty as it directly affects our honor. 

### Without honor there is nothing. 

Here is a few meaningful quotes to inspire you to honor your duty and secure yourself as a dutiful person. 

> <sup>4</sup>Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home." ~ [Mark 6:4](http://biblehub.com/mark/6-4.htm)

> <sup>17</sup>Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king. ~ [1 Peter 2:17](http://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-17.htm)

And for some non biblical quotes... Remember there is little we retain when we die besides our honor. Allah will judge us based on the honorable actions we performed while in this world.

> "Who sows virtue reaps honor" ~ [Leonardo da Vinci](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/l/leonardoda124544.html) <!--more-->

> "A person dishonored is worst than dead." ~ Miguel De Cervantes

> "Better to die ten thousand deaths than wound my honor." ~ Joseph Addison

> "For one who has been honored, dishonor is worse than death." ~ [Bhagavad Gita](http://asitis.com/2/34.html)

> "He who has lost honor can lose nothing more." ~ [Publilius Syrus](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/p/publiliuss378288.html)

So remember that regardless of how financially rich you might be, if you
neglect your duty you will lack the honor you need to be respected and treated
as if you have meaning. <strong>Without honor there is nothing</strong>.
